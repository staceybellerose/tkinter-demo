# tkinter Demo

This repository contains several simple scripts that demonstrate how to use tkinter to create GUI applications in Python.

## Installing tkinter

### Using Homebrew On MacOS

Use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install Python, Tk, and tkinter:

```
brew install python3
brew install tk
brew install python-tk
```

### Without Homebrew

See [this page](http://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html) for details on installing Python, Tk, and tkinter on Windows, Linux, or Mac without Homebrew.

Most Linux distributions have Python, Tk, and tkinter installed by default. If yours does not, check your package manager or use the link above.

## Running the code

From the command line, run

```
python3 scriptname.py
```

where scriptname.py is one of the demo scripts in this repository.
